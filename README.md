## API Documentation

### Easy class definition

To define a class, just use the `oo.Class` method:

    oo.Class("{ClassName}", [BaseClasses], [Mixins], [Definition]);

  * The first argument must be the class name, usually the same name as the variable you assign it to.
  * The final argument will be the definition of the class.  It is optional but usually needed.
  * Base classes and mixins can be passed after the class name (first argument) and before the definition (final argument), and they will contribute to the blueprint of the class.

You can do this:

    var MyClass = oo.Class("MyClass", {

      getName: function(){
        return this.name;
      },

      setName: function(value) {
        this.name = value;
        return this;
      }

    });

... instead of this:

    var MyClass = function(){};
    
    MyClass.prototype.getName = function() {
      return this.name;
    }

    MyClass.prototype.setName = function(value) {
      this.name = value;
      return this;
    }

### Use the `new` operator

Like normal classes in JavaScript (and other languages), you may use the `new` keyword to instantiate your classes.

    var myInstance = new MyClass();

### Methods are just functions that refer to `this`

The `this` object is a special keyword that refers to the instance of the class in which the code is run:

    var MyClass = oo.Class("MyClass", {

      methodThatGetsTheNameField: function() {
        return this.name;
      }

    });

In the above snippet, `this` will refer to different objects depending on which one the function is called for.  In the following code, two separate instances of `MyClass` are given different `name` values, and while the same method (`methodThatGetsTheNameField`) is called, the return is different:

    var myClassInstance1 = new MyClass();
    var myClassInstance2 = new MyClass();

    myClassInstance1.name = "One";
    myClassInstance2.name = "Two";

    myClassInstance1.methodThatGetsTheNameField()
    // returns "One"

    myClassInstance2.methodThatGetsTheNameField()
    // returns "Two"

### Class methods

Methods beginning with `$` will not become instance methods (i.e. bound to instances of the class), but will become static class methods on the class itself.

    var MyClass = oo.Class("MyClass", {
      $alert: function(message){
        alert(message);
      }
    });

    MyClass.$alert("Hello");
    // alerts "Hello"

    var instance = new MyClass();
    instance.$alert(); // fails

### Constructors with the `init` method

The special `init` function will be called each time a new instance is created, and allows you to perform initialization activities for the class.

    var MyClass = oo.Class("MyClass", {
    
      init: function() {
        // set stuff up
      }

    });

### Check for classes with `.$isClass` and get it with `.$class`

To see if an object is an `oo.Class`, just do this:

    if (object.$isClass) {
      // the object IS an oo Class
    } else {
      // it is not
    }

The `.$class` field contains the class that was used to create the object.

    var MyClass1 = oo.Class("MyClass1", {
      numberOnOne: function(){ return 1; } 
    });
    var MyClass2 = oo.Class("MyClass2", {
      numberOnTwo: function(){ return 2; } 
    });
    
    function getNumber(object) {
      switch (object.$class) {
        case MyClass1:
          return object.numberOnOne();
        case MyClass2:
          return object.numberOnTwo();
      }
    }

    var i1 = new MyClass1();
    var i2 = new MyClass2();

    alert( getNumber(i1) );
    // alerts "1"

    alert( getNumber(i2) );
    // alerts "2"

You can actually create new instances of any object like this:

    var newObject = new existingObject.$class();

### Base classes

Inheritance allows you to build general functionality that can then be specialized.  For more information, see the [inheritance article on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming).

    var BaseClass = oo.Class("BaseClass", {
      baseMethod: function() {
        return 123;
      }
    });

    var ChildClass = oo.Class("ChildClass", BaseClass, {
      childMethod: function() {
        return 456;
      }
    });

    var i = new ChildClass();

    alert( i.childMethod() );
    // alerts "456"

    alert( i.baseMethod() );
    // alerts "123"

### Mix-ins

Mix-ins are usually dumber than full base classes, but can be any kind of JavaScript object that has functions worth reusing.  In the following example, the `LovelyMethods` object is _mixed in_ to the class definition.  Notice how the `getName` method becomes available to instances of `MyClass`.

    var LovelyMethods = {

      getName: function() {
        return this.name;
      }

    };

    var MyClass = oo.Class("MyClass", LovelyMethods, {

      setName: function(n) {
        this.name = n;
      }

    });

    var i = new MyClass();
    i.setName("Mat");

    alert( i.getName() );
    // alerts "Mat"

## Events

  * New in `v1.2`

Events allow you to write classes with built-in support for any kind of events, including the ability for other objects to observe the events, and trigger them.

### Using events

Each instance of a class with `oo.Events` enabled has their own eventing mechanism.

#### Adding events to your objects

To add events to a class, just use the `oo.Events` mixin:

    var MyClass = oo.Class("MyClass", oo.Events, { /* your definition */ });

Now, instances of `MyClass` will have access to the `on` and `fire` methods.

#### Adding listeners

    var myObj = new MyClass();
    myObj.on("event-name", function(){
      /* TODO: handle the event */
    });

or to listen to an objects own events:

    init: function(){
      this.on("event-name", this.onEvent)
    },
    onEvent: function(){
      // my own callback
    }

  * Returning `false` from an event callback will prevent further event callbacks from being called.  Best practice is not to return anything if you do not want to stop execution.

#### Firing events

    // fire the event
    myObj.fire("event-name", arg1, arg2, arg3);

or from inside the object:

    something: function(){
      this.fire("event-name", arg1, arg2, arg3)
    }

#### Automagic _before_ events using `withEvent` method

The `withEvent` method allows you to easily trigger two events, before and after running a code block.

    // usage:
    object.withEvent(eventName, [arguments, ] codeblock);

For example:

    // MyClass has an event called 'speak'
    var myObj = new MyClass();

    // ask asks the user for a Yes/No.
    // Raises the before:speak and speak events.
    ask: function(question){
      this.withEvent("ask", question, function(){
        return confirm(question);
      });
    }

Calling the `ask` method above will cause the following things to happen:

  * The `before:ask` event is raised with the 'question' as the only argument
  * Assuming none of the `before:ask` handlers return false, the code block is next executed
  * Finally, the `ask` event is called, with two arguments; the 'question' and the return from the codeblock.

Event listeners might look like this:

    myObj.on("before:ask", function(question){
      // TODO: do something before we ask the user
    });
    myObj.on("ask", function(question, result){
      // TODO: the event has happened, and the result
      // is the last argument.
    });

#### Removing listeners

To stop listening to an event, you can call the `removeCallback` method:

    if (!myObj.removeCallback("event-name", myFunc)) {
      // TODO: handle failure
    }

  * The `myFunc` argument must be the exact same object being removed, remember that using the `bind` method creates a new function each time.

### Defined events

You can predefine events by mixing in the `oo.Events` mixin (see above), and by adding an `events` string array property in your definition.  Each event name will cause a shortcut methods to be created which is the cleanest interface for your class users.

    var MyClass = oo.Class("MyClass", oo.Events, {
      events: ["complete", "error", "progress"]
    });

Instances of `MyClass` will each have three extra methods; `complete`, `error` and `progress`.  These methods can be used to add listeners and fire the events.

#### Shortcut methods: Adding listeners

To add a listener to an event, just call the method and pass in a single `function` argument:

    var obj = new MyClass();
    obj.complete(function(){
      alert("It is complete!");
    });

#### Shortcut methods: Firing events

To fire an event, call the shortcut method with no arguments (or with any other arguments, apart from a single `function` argument):

    // fire the event
    obj.complete();

    // fire the event with some arguments
    obj.complete(true, 123, data);

### Class wide events

  * New in `v1.2.1`

When you mix in `oo.Events` to your class, the class itself also gets it's `on` and `fire` methods.  Listeners bound to the class will get called when _any_ event of that kind is fired on any of the instances.  The first argument will be the instance that is raising the event, followed by any other arguments that were passed when firing the event.

For example,

    var Animal = oo.Class("Animal", oo.Events, {
      init: function(name){
        this.name = name;
        this.on("speak", function(instance, noise){
          console.info(instance.name + " just made this noise: " + noise);
        });
      },
      say: function(noise) {
        this.fire("speak", noise);
      }
    });

    var dog = new Animal("dog");
    var cat = new Animal("cat");

    dog.say("woof");
    cat.say("meow");

    // result in the console will be:
    //
    //   dog just made this noise: woof
    //   cat just made this noise: meow

## Advanced inheritance

### Accessing overridden base methods

If a child class overrides a method in the base class, you may still access the base class method using `instance.{BaseClassKind}.{method}` pattern.

    var BaseClass = oo.Class("BaseClass", {
      theMethod: function() {
        return "BASE method working with " + this.name;
      }
    });

    var ChildClass = oo.Class("ChildClass", BaseClass, {
      theMethod: function() {

        // call the base version
        var t = this.BaseClass.theMethod();

        // make a change
        return t.replace("BASE", "CHILD");

      }
    });

    var i = new ChildClass();

    i.name = "Mat";

    alert( i.theMethod() );
    // alerts "CHILD method working with Mat"

    alert( i.BaseClass.theMethod() );
    // alerts "BASE method working with Mat"

### Multiple base classes

One class may have multiple base classes, but each base class will share the instance memory.  Any clashes in method names can be resolved by using the `instance.{BaseClassKind}.{method}` pattern.

    var BaseClass1 = oo.Class("BaseClass1", {
      theMethod: function() {
        return "BASE 1 method working with " + this.name;
      },
      helloFromBase1: function() {
        return "Hello from Base 1";
      }
    });
    
    var BaseClass2 = oo.Class("BaseClass2", {
      theMethod: function() {
        return "BASE 2 method working with " + this.name;
      },
      helloFromBase2: function() {
        return "Hello from Base 2";
      }
    });
    
    var ChildClass = oo.Class("ChildClass", BaseClass1, BaseClass2, {
      theMethod: function() {
        return "CHILD method working with " + this.name;
      }
    });

    var i = new ChildClass();

    i.name = "Mat";

    alert( i.theMethod() );
    // alerts "CHILD method working with Mat"

    alert( i.helloFromBase1() );
    // alerts "Hello from Base 1"
    
    alert( i.helloFromBase2() );
    // alerts "Hello from Base 2"

    alert( i.BaseClass1.theMethod() );
    // alerts "BASE 1 method working with Mat"
    
    alert( i.BaseClass2.theMethod() );
    // alerts "BASE 2 method working with Mat"

## Special class methods

### $beforeInherited

    (item) $beforeInherited(newClass, argumentsArray);

The `$beforeInherited` method is called just before a class gets inherited.

  * `this` will be the class itself
  * `newClass` is the new class that is being defined.
  * `argumentsArray` is an array of the arguments that were passed to `oo.Class`.
    * [0] - Class name string.
    * [n...] - Middle arguments will be base classes and mixins.
    * [len-1] - The last argument will be the definition of the class.

### $afterInherited

    $afterInherited(newClass, argumentsArray)

The `$afterInherited` method is called after the class has been inherited.

  * `this` will be the class itself
  * `newClass` is the new class that is being defined.
  * `argumentsArray` is an array of the arguments that were passed to `oo.Class`.
    * [0] - Class name string.
    * [n...] - Middle arguments will be base classes and mixins.
    * [len-1] - The last argument will be the definition of the class.

### $afterClassDefined

    $afterClassDefined(newClass, argumentsArray)

The `$afterClassDefined` method is called after a new class has been completely defined.  I.e. mixins and base classes that appear after this class in the `oo.Class` method will have all been handled before this method is called.

  * `this` will be the class itself
  * `newClass` is the compelte new class that has been defined.
  * `argumentsArray` is an array of the arguments that were passed to `oo.Class`.
    * [0] - Class name string.
    * [n...] - Middle arguments will be base classes and mixins.
    * [len-1] - The last argument will be the definition of the class.

## Helper methods

`oo` provides some additional helpful methods.

### `ooextend`

    ooextend(source, destination)

The `ooextend` method copies properties from `source` into `destination`.  The `destination` object is modified.

### `oobind`

    var newFunc = oobind({function}, {thisObject}, [{arg1}, [{arg2...}]])

or

    var newFunc = {function}.bind({thisObject}, [{arg1}, [{arg2...}]])

The `oobind` method allows you to bind context (and arguments) to functions.  This is used by `oo.Class` internally, but can be invaliable when coding JavaScript.

NOTE: Newer editions of the language have their own [bind method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) that will eventually replace `oobind`.  It works, however, in the same way.
